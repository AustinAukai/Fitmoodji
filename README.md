# Fitmoodji

Working out does not come easy for many, whether it is because there is just no time or because you are just not motivated. Our team wanted to create an app that would take working out and make fun while at the same time holding hte user accountable. Introducing fitmoodji, get movin' to get the mood in. The way our app works is simple, the more you workout the better the user's fitmoodji mood will be. When there is a lack of activity the fitmoodji mood will get worse until it gets to the lowest mood. There are 5 moods that the app can asign the user.

**How to use the app**
  - Either log in or create an account on the fitmoodji web app.
  - The user will then be sent to the homepage that will display a mood.
  - The user can then click on the workout dashboard, which will display a workout of the     day that the app has chosen. If the user would like to do their own workout than they     can click on the "Do your own workout!" button, otherwise click on the "challenge         yourself!" button to do the WOD created by the app.
  - Once the user is done with their workout, they can click on the workout log to see all     of their past workouts.
  - Once returned to the homepage the user's fitmoodji mood will change to a higher modd.
